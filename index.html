        <h1>Construction Materials Through History</h1>
        
        <p>The major construction materials of earlier times were wood and masonry: brick, stone, clay, tile, and similar materials (Figure 6.1.). A tile is a flat square piece of baked clay or other material used for covering floors or baths. As a thin curved piece of baked clay, it is used for covering roofs. Bricks or stones were held together with a mixture of cement or lime, sand, and water called mortar.</p>

        <p>The Greeks and Romans sometimes used iron rods to strengthen their buildings. The columns of the Parthenon in Athens, for example, have holes drilled in them for iron bars that have now rusted away. The Romans developed an excellent waterproof cement called pozzolana, made by mixing water, lime, and sand with a fine powder ground from volcanic rock found near Pozzuoli (hence the name).</p>

        <p><strong>Cement</strong> is a material that binds together the mixture. It reacts with water, becoming cementitious, and is termed hydrated cement in this state. In contrast to traditional lime mortar, cement does not need contact with the air in order to harden off. Cement is therefore a hydraulic binder.</p>

        <p><strong>Concrete</strong> is really an "artificial stone." Consisting of a dense medium of cement, water, and aggregates such as sand or gravel, it is poured into shuttering or formwork (Figure 6.2.) and is compacted by agitating and pressing down. Fresh concrete sets and becomes hardened concrete. The commonest concrete in use today is Portland cement concrete. It was invented in 1824 by a bricklayer called Joseph Aspdin.</p>

        <p>Portland cement is a mixture of limestone and clay, which is heated and then ground into a powder. It is mixed at or near the construction site with sand, aggregate (small stones, crushed rock, or gravel), and water to make concrete. Different proportions of the ingredients produce concrete with different strength and weight. Concrete is very versatile; it can be poured, pumped, or even sprayed into all kinds of shapes. Whereas steel has great tensile strength, concrete has great strength under compression. Thus, the two substances complement each other. They also complement each other in another way: they have almost the same rate of contraction and expansion. They therefore can work together in situations where both compression and tension are factors. Steel rods are embedded in concrete to make reinforced concrete (Figure 6.3.) in concrete beams or structures where tension will develop. Concrete with steel reinforcement is a versatile material widely used in the load-bearing structure of buildings. Still another advantage is that steel does not rust in concrete. Acid corrodes steel, whereas concrete has an alkaline chemical reaction, the opposite of acid.</p>

        <p>Steel, as a very tough and strong metal, has many useful applications in a wide range of constructions. The best building materials are strong, durable, and easily obtainable. Steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, is the most commonly used alloy in industry.</p>
